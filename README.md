# Tango Card - Rewards as a Service

# RaaS API - Version 1 

## Sandbox credentials
Please email sdk@tangocard.com to receive credentials for the RaaS API Sandbox environment. 
The endpoint for the RESTful interface on the Sandbox environment is https://sandbox.tangocard.com/raas/v1/

To review the end-to-end user experience, any Tango Cards purchased on the Sandbox environment can be redeemed on the [Tango Card Sandbox website](https://integration-www.tangocard.com/)

## Test drive the RaaS API

You have couple of options to test drive the RaaS API without even writing a single line of code.

### RaaS API Test Console
One way to test drive the RaaS API, you can visit the 
[RaaS API Test Console](https://integration-www.tangocard.com/test_raas_api). 

Using the Test Console you can go through each resource supported by the RaaS API, 
the requests and the responses for each of these resources.

### Mashape
Another way to test drive the RaaS API (albiet only against our Production environment) is 
[Rewards as a Service](https://www.mashape.com/tangocard/rewards-as-a-service/) page on Mashape.

## Production credentials
Once you are ready to move to production, you need to agree to the [RaaS API Terms & Conditions](https://creator.zoho.com/shighet/raas-api-agreement/form-perma/RaaS_API_Agreement/U12njtAWxArN6VnavC92RTZkw2kUOQhbkZxKsKD0jHAOqFwxvQRSQKfU2xW8xytQuMPHUafDD3P0vnsXVKDYAjOOR3qHOdq7kQHr/). 
Once you agree to the Terms & Conditions, we will create credentials on the Production environment and follow up with you. 
The endpoint for the RESTful interface on the Production environment is https://api.tangocard.com/raas/v1/

## TangoCard.com credentials and RaaS credentials
Our previous version of the API uses credentials (username and password) created on TangoCard.com

However, the RaaS API uses a Platform name and a Platform key that needs to be created for you. 

You can't mix the credentials for TangoCard.com site with the credentials for the RaaS API.

## What is RaaS

With our RaaSâ„¢ API you can elegantly knit a sophisticated rewards program into your platform. Create an account, fund an account, manage catalog, send rewards, and get order history - all available on demand, real time, and as a service.


## System-wide Notes

* [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is the only currently-supported content type for inputs or outputs. It is not required that the requests contain an Accept header, but if they do it should contain "application/json" or "*/*.
* All calls require the platform's authentication. Authentication uses [HTTP Basic auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) with the platform name as the username and the platform access key as the password. These will be assigned by Tango Card.
* All dates will/must be represented in a format that is compatible with [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) (for example: *2013-02-21T20:37:07-07:00*).
* Platform will be responsible for handling access to it's accounts (e.g. not allowing ACC1 to place an order using ACC2's account)... requests from authenticated platforms against their accounts will be implicitly trusted.
* Whenever money is concerned, it is in cents (e.g. $4 = 400).
* Fields in the RaaS API response objects may be added at any time. This means that whatever is used to demarshall the JSON responses into native data types needs to be able to handle unknown fields without failing.
* All responses may include a `system_message` field. This is a note from TangoCard to the platforms and not intended for end users. This will notify of things like planned outages and should be monitored.




# Resources



## Account Resources

The following is a section of resources related to the platform's accounts.

* An "account identifier" in the system can be whatever is convenient for the platform as long as it adheres to the following rules:
 * Between 5 and 96 characters in length (inclusive).
 * Must be made up exclusively of: alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), underscore (_), dash (-), or plus (+).
 * Must be unique to the platform.
* A "customer" is a mechanism for denoting a company, department, etc an account belongs to.

# Troubleshooting

## Communicatin Problems

### SSL/TLS
Server environments are often set up to only trust the absolute minimum number of Certificate Authorities they can get away with. As such, many environments may not have the certificates available to allow your application to validate our certificates. As all communication with Tango Card's RaaS API is handled over SSL, not having the certificate chain in place to allow you to validate our cert will (at best) disallow communication or (at worst) expose you to the potential for [main-in-the-middle attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). Thus, it is essential that the environment be set up to allow for safe SSL communication.

There are a few ways to acheive this (like adding the CA's cert to the system's trusted list), but probably the easiest (and most portable) would be to include the certificate in your application. The Certificate Authority that issued our server certificates is [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/), and we have one of their *DigiCert High Assurance CA-3* certs. You can get DigiCert's root and intermediate certificates from [https://www.digicert.com/digicert-root-certificates.htm](their site). Alternatively, you can download the entire chain needed [here](ssl/tangocard_digicert_chain.pem) in PEM format.

Once you have the certificate in hand it will need to be referenced from your application's code. The details on how to do this are highly specific to the library being used to make the connection, but here are a few examples to demonstrate the idea:

```ruby
# Ruby (using net/https)
https = Net::HTTP.new('integration-api.tangocard.com', 443) 
https.use_ssl = true 
https.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER 
https.ca_file = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), "../ca_certs/tangocard_digicert_chain.pem") 
https.request_get('/fake/example')
```

```php
// PHP (using curl)
$curl = curl_init('https://integration-api.tangocard.com/fake/example');
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, true);
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_CAINFO, __DIR__ . "../ca_certs/tangocard_digicert_chain.pem");
curl_exec($curl);
```


One thing to take note of in both examples is that OpenSSL is being instructed to **VERIFY PEER**. This setting is essential as without it you will know that your communication is encrypted, but you won't know who it is you're talking to.

Note: We use a wild-card certificate from DigiCert and hence the certificate chain is the same for both Sandbox (https://sandbox.tangocard.com) and Production (https://api.tangocard.com) environments.
